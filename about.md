I perform interdisciplinary research on wildlife conservation issues, particularly human-carnivore coexistence in Washington State.

### More Information

I am currently a graduate student at the [University of Washington-Seattle](http:/www.uw.edu) School of Environment and Forest Sciences [SEFS](http://www.cfr.washington.edu/). My Urban Ecology lab advisor [Dr. John Marzluff](http://apps.sefs.uw.edu/Public/People/FacultyProfile.aspx?PID=10)  secured a grant for the ["Feasibility of a Wolf Economy"](https://reeis.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/0232727-feasibility-of-a-wolf-economy-for-washington.html) that formed the basis of my dissertation.

In 2016, the [Bullitt Foundation](http://www.bullitt.org) awarded me their 10th annual Environmental Leadership prize. The Bullitt prize is a huge honor for me and encourages me to continue investing in conservation, environment, and education.

Following on the Bullitt prize, the *Sunday Monitor* newspaper named me one of the "Top 40 Women Under 40" in my home country of Uganda.
